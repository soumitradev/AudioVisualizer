# Audio Visualizer
This is an old project (around 2 weeks old) in which I used FFTs to create a simple audiovisualizer. It reads in a music file (.wav format) and spits out a .mp4 file with a graph of the frequencies. A sample .mp4 file is in the repo. To run this, make sure to replace tst.wav everywhere in your code with your wav file, and make sure the ffmpeg command at the end spits out the video file name you want.

 I might document and rewrite for live audio using pygame later.

<!-- The final pygame implementation is in `audio_visualiser.py` -->

Read the Jupyter Notebook for more details on how I thought this out and how this works.
