    "Let's say we have a function $f(t)$. Note how this function varies with time, similar to an audio signal. The domain of this function is from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$. Now, we want to transform this function such that the domain changes from time to that of frequency.\n",

    "But what frequency does $X_K$ correspond to?\n",
    "The frequency resolution is the $\\frac{sampling \\hspace{4pt} frequency}{number \\hspace{4pt} of \\hspace{4pt} samples}$. This is the increment in actual frequency for each increment in $n$. Here, we took 8 samples per second, and we have 8 total samples. So, the frequency increases by $\\frac{8}{8} = 1Hz$ for each increment in $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $X_0$ is $0Hz$, $X_1$ is $1Hz$, $X_2$ is $2Hz$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we notice that the amplitude of the wave ($r$) is 4 for some reason, and also appears at $X_7$!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it reappear at $7Hz$? Well, the fourier transform yields a 2 sided symmetric graph. So, the upper half of the data we have after the fourier transform is an exact copy of the data of the lower half. So, for our application, we simply ignore it. Now, this presents a problem. We can analyse only half of the frequencies as our sampling rate. This half the value of sample rate is called the *Nyquist Limit*. For usual audio signals, the sampling rate is $44100Hz$. This puts our Nyquist limit at $22050Hz$. This is exactly the range of human hearing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why is  the amplitude 4? When we originally made our curve ($1Hz$ sine wave with amplitude 1), we specifically set the amplitude to 1. Why do we get 4? Let us see why this is. But before that, since we threw away half our data, we need to double our current data to preserve information. And we do. The ampilitudes of the *useful* frequencies below the Nyquist Limit are doubled. Now, we have 8! This is nowhere close to 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we also took 8 samples. So, averaging our data over the 8 samples gives us the correct $1Hz$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we did get the amplitude of our frequency. What about the phase shift?\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase shift for our $X_1$ (which is the only $X$ below Nyquist Limit with a non zero amplitude), is $arctan(\\frac{B_K}{A_K})$. However, our $A_K = 0$ since it's the real part of $X_K$ and our $X_1$ is $-8i$ after the doubling.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we use the $arccos$ form for the phase angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta = arccos(\\frac{A_K}{\\sqrt{A_K^2 + B_K^2}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta = arccos(0)$$\n",
    "$$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\hspace{4pt} or \\hspace{4pt} \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since our phasor is equal to $-8i$, we know that $\\theta > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, our $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the phase angle is for a *cosine* wave. So factoring in our frequency and phase shift,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = 1 \\cdot cos(2\\pi t + \\frac{3\\pi}{2})$$\n",
    "$$f(t) = sin(2\\pi t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what we just did is a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). This algorithm has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This can be really slow, and we can trade some accuracy for speed if we're dealing with realtime audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there's another algorithm called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that programs generally use. FFT has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log{}n)$, which is much faster than DFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy has an FFT function built into it that we can, and will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to take this mathematical idea and apply it to Audio signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most audio files have a sample rate of $44,100Hz$, which we will use. Also, we need to draw a 30 FPS video. We need to process packets as they come in 30 times per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be slow, so we'll use a clever techinque called *interpolation*. We will calculate 15 times per second, and calculate intermediate values in between 2 calculations. So, we calculate 15 times a second, and draw intermediate frames in between them, giving us an effective 30 FPS video.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also make the video smoother as the bars in the video won't fluctuate as much since an intermediate value is being calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we're grabbing 15 parts of a one second clip, which contains 44,100 samples, each time we calculate the FFT, we need to feed it $\\frac{44100}{15} = 2940$ samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have an audio file of $T$ seconds, we split the $T \\cdot 44100$ samples into $15 \\cdot T$ parts of $2940$ samples each.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know, our frequency resolution is $\\frac{sampling \\hspace{4pt} frequency}{number \\hspace{4pt} of \\hspace{4pt} samples} = \\frac{44,100}{2940} = 15Hz$ which is approximately the frequency difference between the note E2 and F2, which makes our model just perfect to differentiate musical notes!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not what we want. If we have bins of 15Hz width from 0Hz to 22050Hz, we have 1470 bins!\n",
    "\n",
    "We still need to classify these bins better and merge them until we have about 50 bins (which is also the number of bins I have for the audio visualiser I use to customise my desktop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, just merge every $\\frac{1470}{50} \\approx 30$ bins right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well yes, but that'd not be the best way to do this. That *would* divide the frequencies equally, but that's not how human hearing actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Weber-Fechner Law, our brain is sensitive to signals logarithmically, not linearly. Which means, that the frequencies need to be put in bins logarithmically to make intuitive sense while listening to it. However, this mapping will take time, so instead, we use a rough approximation using a square root graph instead of a logarithmic graph.\n",
    " \n",
    "So, since our bins maxx out at 50, we'll need a square root that varies from 0 to 1 multiplied with the maximum number of bins, 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we put our frequency in the square root. Since this needs to vary from 0 to 1, we divide it with the maximum possible frequency first, or our Nyquist Limit. Also, since we want it to be an integer, we'll floor the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B_i = 50 \\cdot floor(\\sqrt{\\frac{X_K}{X_{max}}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for every increment in $K$, the frequency increases by $15Hz$, and that the value we get is actually for the lower limit of the $15Hz$ range since we still get 0 amplitude for $X_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, since we have 1470 frequencies to process, we classify each of these into a bin, add up the areas of the original bars, and then render a new bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we finally have a bar length we can render to represent the frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since we know that our bin indexes are inetgers that can vary from 0 to 50, let us find the frequencies for the bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_K = X_{max} \\cdot (\\frac{B_i}{50})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our frequencies for the upper limits of the bins are:\n",
    "\n",
    "|$B_i$|Upper Limit ($X_{K+1}$)|\n",

    "So, how exactly do we fit our old data into these new bins?\n",
    "\n",
    "Look, we have data for frequencies from 0 to 15Hz in our first bin. We need data for frequencies from 0 to ~9Hz for our new first bin. So, we take this ampilitude in our first bin, and find the area in the first bin. This is equal to $r * Bin \\hspace{4pt} width = r * 15$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the area below the first bin, or the data below the first bin. To fit it into the second bin, we need only the data from 0Hz to ~9Hz. So, we take that fraction of the area and divide it by the new bin width to get the new height of the bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{new} = \\frac{r * 15}{New \\hspace{4pt} bin \\hspace{4pt} width}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The new bin width in this case is ~9 Hz. So, our height for the 0th Bin will be $\\frac{5r}{3}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us use this formula to find the bin width of the second bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{new, 1} = \\frac{r_{old, 1}*15}{35.28-8.82}$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that the new bin from 8.82Hz to 35.28Hz. Our old bins were from 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, parts of these 3 old bins come into our new bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have our 50 bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice, that we have actual wave ampilitudes in our 50 bins for every packet. How do we convert this to number of pixels for a bar on a screen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, while applying our interpolation, we go through every packet and create a new list of packets. So, we cam apply our amplitude to pixel function here.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to just average each bin out. i.e. take the sum of all bins in a packet, and divide each bin by our sum. This could be an approach, but it depends on the rest of the bins. So, if the volume is really low, and one low amplitude wave exists, it will show up as a full bar in our visualiser. This doesn't reflect the volume of the single wave, and only represents how much percent of the final audio we hear comes from that one wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to divide all bins by the maximum of the bins in a packet. However, this poses a similar problem to what we had before, and does not reflect the actual volume of the wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the best way is to divide it by the global maximum volume of all waves in all packets. This will give the loudest wave in the song an intensity of 1, and adjust fainter waves accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we will notice is that very small changes in audio cause very big fluctuations in wave intensity. We will have to apply a smoothing curve before we apply our amplitude to pixel function. Since music contains very narrow peaks of frequencies (like notes), we will square the amplitudes, and then fit them on a logarithmic curve. Just by modelling the range of the functions, I came to a good enough smoothing function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\elln((\\frac{amplitude}{global \\hspace{4pt} maximum \\hspace{4pt} ampilitude})^2 + 1)}{\\elln(2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, our intensities have the range $[0, 1]$, and we simply need to multiply by the visualiser window height to get our pixel size of the bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we just need to render every bin in every packet and play audio. This can be done very easily with some basic pygame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now done."
